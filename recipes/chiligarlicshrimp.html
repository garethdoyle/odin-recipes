    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a wonderfully spicy asian inspired chili garlic shrimp. It is simple to make and Whole30.</p>
        <p>I definitely like the heat, but I tend to tone it back for the family so they can enjoy it without
            burning their mouths. Having a good blender definitely helps, but it isn't necessary. Having a 
            blender is, but it doesn't have to be a Vitamix.
