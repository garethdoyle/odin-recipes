    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a delicious and simple meal using tilapia to create an incredibly tasty treat.</p>
        <p>I like to add some spicy peppers in there, so the recipe calls for jalapenos, but try to
        make them spicy ones. The spicier jalapenos tend to have the dried striations down their bodies.
        You can also use red jalapenos, but these tend to be significantly spicier, so be warned.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb fresh tilapia fillets;</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Paleo cooking fat; (i.e. garlic olive oil)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped;</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced;</li>
            <li>1 or 2 jalape√±o pepper(s), finely chopped;</li>
            <li>2 cups tomatoes, diced;</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped;</li>
            <li>3 tbsp lime juice;</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste;</li>
            <li>1 avocado, sliced; (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Tortilla Shells</li>
        </ul>    
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over a medium-high heat, combine the cooking fat with onions.
                Cook until the onions are soft and translucent in color. Add garlic until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the tilapia and allow the fillets to cook for 3 to 4 minutes on one side prior
                 to flipping. As the fish begins to cook through, use a fork to break it apart into 
                 flaky pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the jalapeno pepper, tomatoes, cilantro and lime juice to the mix and then season 
                with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 minutes before removing from heat.</li>
        </ol>
